<h1>Favorite Horror Movie Franchises</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>1. Halloween</h2>
    <p>This franchise scared me as a child, but it has become my comfort movie due to the fact i always watched them with my mum
    </p>
<h2>2. Scream</h2>
<p> This is a close favorite of mine as well. First one is a masterpiece and it always has a consistant delivery with its sequals. Not a bad movie in the franchise.

<h2>3. Always being open to something new</h2>
<p> I dont have a 3rd fav franchise yet but I'm always open to something new because the genre is always evolving and expanding
